				<p class="mt-3">
					Foreign university admissions often require applicants to demonstrate proficiency in 
					English through tests like the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and assess their 
					academic readiness through exams such as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). TOEFL 
					evaluates the applicant's ability to understand and use English in an academic setting,
					 including listening, reading, speaking, and writing skills. Similarly, the GRE assesses verbal reasoning, 
					 quantitative reasoning, critical thinking, and analytical writing skills. 
					 High scores in these exams not only validate the applicant's language 
					 and academic abilities but also enhance their chances of securing admission to 
					 prestigious foreign universities. Additionally, strong performance in these exams 
					 may sometimes serve as prerequisites for scholarships or assistantships,
					 further emphasizing their importance in the admission process.</p>
